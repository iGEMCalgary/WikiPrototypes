            <h2> Abstract </h2>

            <p>
                Canola oil is one of Canada’s leading exports and supplies 27 billion dollars to the economy every year.
                Unfortunately, volatile climate combined with a short growing season results in a problematic condition known as green seed.
            </p>
            <h6>
                What is green seed?
            </h6>
            <p>
                Immature canola seeds contain a high concentration of chlorophyll which gives them a characteristic green hue.
                Under normal conditions, this colour fades as enzymes breakdown the chlorophyll in the developing seeds.
                However, if the plants are exposed to frost before they are able to fully mature, the chlorophyll degradation pathway is disrupted which causes the seeds to remain green at harvest.
                When the seeds are pressed to produce oil, the resulting solution contains a high concentration of chlorophyll which leads to faster spoilage and ultimately lowers the grade—and thus the monetary value—of the oil.
                It is estimated that green seed contributes to annual losses of up to 150 million dollars.
            </p>
            <h6>
                Our solution
            </h6>
            <p>
                <!--SECRET
            Our team aims to address this issue by using chlorophyll-binding proteins and emulsified water droplets to isolate and remove the chlorophyll molecules from the oil.
            -->
                Extracted chlorophyll molecules will be repurposed into a compound known as pheophorbide a.
                Pheophorbide a has applications in anticancer and antifungal phototreatments, however it's chemical synthesis is difficult, lowering it's accessibility.
