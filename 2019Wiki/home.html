			<h2> Abstract </h2>

			<p>Canola oil is one of Canada’s leading exports and supplies 27 billion dollars to the economy every year. Unfortunately for farmers, the volatile climate combined with a short growing season often results in a problematic condition known as green seed.</p>

			<p>Immature canola seeds contain a high concentration of chlorophyll which gives them a characteristic green hue. Under normal conditions, this colour fades as enzymes act to breakdown the chlorophyll in the developing seeds. However, if the plants are exposed to frost before they are able to fully mature, the chlorophyll degradation pathway is disrupted which causes the seeds to remain green at harvest. When the seeds are pressed to produce oil, the resulting solution contains a high concentration of chlorophyll which leads to faster spoilage and ultimately lowers the grade—and thus the monetary value—of the oil. It is estimated that green seeds contribute to annual losses of up to 150 million dollars.</p>

			<p>Our team aims to address this issue by using chlorophyll-binding proteins and emulsified water droplets to isolate and remove the chlorophyll molecules from the oil. The extracted chlorophyll molecules will then be biologically repurposed into a compound known as pheophorbide a. Pheophorbide a has been studied for its applications in anticancer and antifungal phototreatments, however it is hard to chemically synthesize resulting in its lower accessibility.</p>
